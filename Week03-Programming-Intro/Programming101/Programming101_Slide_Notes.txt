What is Programming: Solving problems using codes.
Problem-solving             : Creativity activity
Learning programming syntax : Analytical activity

SORTING APP

Possible Questions:
Is there a limit of inputs?
Are there several input fields  or one?
If there is only one, how is the correct input would be? Should they seperated by coma or space

Before coding visualize the steps:
Inputs  : Input digits in one field, they are seperated by comas
Process : Sorting algorithm
Outputs : Print digits in order
Then Pseudo Code

PROCESS TO WRITE A PROGRAM:
Before starting programming discover Inputs, Processes and Outputs.
CORE DEFINITION OF A PROGRAM: Inputs, process, outputs
Nouns: are usually your inouts and outputs.
Verbs: describe your process (prompt, calculate, display)

TIP CALCUALTOR APP
Inputs  : Noun (Bill amount, tip rate)
Process : Verb (Calculate tip) 
Outputs : Noun (Tip amount, total amount)

TEST DRIVEN DEVELOPEMENT
Simple test plan: List the programs inputs and expected result
Inputs:
Expected result:
Actual result:  
Think edge and corner cases. They can show constraints of program

PSEUDOCODE
Initialize  : Set an initial value
Prompt      : For user input
Display     : For output on the screen

TIP CALCULATOR PSEUDOCODE

TipCalculator
    Initialize billAmount to 0
    Initialize tip to 0
    Initialize tipRate to 0
    Initialize total to 0

    Prompt for billAmount with "How much is bill?"
    Prompt for tipRate with "How much is your tip rate?"

    Convert billAmount to number
    Convert billAmount to number

    tip = billAmount * 15/100
    total = billAmount + tip

    Display = "Your tip: " + tip
    Display = "Your total bill is" + total
End
